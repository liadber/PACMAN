# Pacman-Game
A Pacman game website I created with my partner @Amit223.
This is our first trial in Java Script using the possibilties of HTML5 with <canvas>.

1. Create your own user for the session on "Sign Up"
2. Log in on "Login"
3. Choose settings by yourself or just click on "Start!" in the end of the page
4. Click "Start"

Enjoy!
